#PWA Issues/Features Needed To Do

- GUI need to be locked, so no scrolling outside of the chat
- Messages should be pushed up with the touch keyboard (mobile devices)
	- If text field is clicked then keyboard will pop up without pushing otherwise field will push fine (tested on iOS)
- Gestures to open and close sidebar (hamburger menu icon is weirdly placed and unintuitive)
	- Click on channel to hide sidebar
	- Click on message area to hide sidebar
- When sidebar is open well-scaled and not-well-scaled profile pictures appear beside (when in a channel with a call active)
- Extend GUI to top of iOS menu bar (to take advantage of black-translucent)
- Service worker page (or notification/in-page banner) for updates/offline
- Calling doesn't work, PWA nor webapp ask for mic/video perms
- Keyboard autocorrect overlaps with text field (iPadOS on iPad Pro /w FaceID)
- Gray color of sidebar should extend higher (to sit under black-transluscent iOS menu bar)
